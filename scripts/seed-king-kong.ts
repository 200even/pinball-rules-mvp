**Story:** Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll, and Carl Denham have arrived on the mysterious Terror Island to uncover its secrets. Denham, the ambitious filmmaker, aims to capture King Kong, the legendary beast that roams the island, while Jack and Ann are more concerned with uncovering the island's mystical riches.`,

**Skill Shot Benefits:**
- Each skill shot adds initial ball-save time (on default settings)
- Each unique skill shot made during a game instantly adds a letter to KING KONG
- If the ball falls back into the shooter lane during single-ball play, a "Sneak-In" award starting at 1M is earned

Shoot the gong to light island scenes at the same shot that was used to start them. On Pro models (lacking a gong), island arrows must be collected: one arrow for the first scene, increasing by one per scene to a max of five.

- 60-second time limit per scene
- Timer can be extended by +15 seconds by hitting the gong (once per scene)
- Any multiball can be started during a scene
- Mode timer freezes at 15 seconds during multiball until back to single ball
- Each completed scene awards a map segment

**The Five Island Scenes:**

**1. Save Ann:** Shoot lit shots to build gong value (starts at 3M). Lit shots score 250K + 25K per shot, increase gong by 500K + 50K per shot. Combo shots are worth 2x. Shoot gong 3 times, then final hurry-up shot.

**2. Cross the Chasm:** River entrance is always lit - hitting it raises diverter and lights cliffs ramp. Shoot cliffs ramp to save sailors (base 2M, +500K per sailor). Miss the ramp and lose a sailor (resets to 2M). Combo U-turn after saving awards 2x.

**3. Pterodactyl Attack:** Hit moving drop targets to defeat pterodactyls and light Kong Cave VUK for 2x award. Clean shot triggering rollover above cave makes it 3x. Collect four cave awards to complete.

**4. Stegosaurus Encounter:** Choose easy path (slow flash) or hard path (quick flash). Hard path increases multiplier +1x for rest of mode. Base value starts at 1M, +250K per shot. Need 7 total shots.

**5. Escape the Swamp:** Build punchback jackpot value by shooting flashing shots. After scoring jackpot, shoot upper flipper shot to multiply (side ramp 2x, upper loop 3x, river lane 4x). Collect three jackpots to complete.`,

Shooting "The Cliffs" from upper playfield grants awards over the game span:

- **3, 15...:** KING KONG letter (or 15M if already spelled)
- **6:** Light cliffhanger (TBD on 0.85 code)
- **20:** Light cliffhanger + award map segment  
- **25:** Light Extra Ball

**2x Scoring:**
Orange targets marked with "X" around playfield must all be hit (twice for subsequent attempts). Hit the roving orange target moving left-right to start 2x scoring.

**2x Scoring Rules:**
- Timer extended by shooting lit orange targets
- Each lit orange target scores bonus during 2x
- Timer can be extended 4 times per activation
- Fourth treasure hunt makes 2x much easier (all targets count, any target starts when qualified)

**Power-Ups:**
TBD on 0.85 code - additional power-up mechanics to be implemented in future code updates.`,

        body: `**Lighting Lost Temple:**
Hit gong target twice while at least one unlit drop target is available. Once lit, next right orbit shot (single-ball only) sends ball to mini-flipper and lights an unlit drop target.

**Temple Mechanics:**
Hitting the lit drop target awards one light's progress toward glyph puzzle completion and instantly completes next drop target progress for King Kombos or light kong lock.

**Glyph Puzzle Completion:**
First treasure requires 3 flashing drop targets after lighting Lost Temple. Subsequent treasures require all 4 drop target lights. Shoot island treasure target behind upper drop targets to collect.

**Island Treasures:**
1. **Drillplate of Dunne:** 10M + Super Spinners (30 seconds alternating spinners, 100K + 50K per lit rip)
2. **Lost Skull of Ancients:** 10M + Super Kombos (King Kombos for 30 seconds at 3x value)  
3. **Heart of Keepers:** 10M + Extra Ball
4. **Moonstone of N'zai:** 10M + Super Rapids (30 seconds, all shots multiply river lane points)
5. **Obsidian Dagger:** 100M
6. **Serpent's Eye:** 100M

**Treasure Hunt Bonus:**
Each Island Treasure adds +1x multiplier to next treasure hunt jackpot.`,

**Bonus X Sources:**
- Each drop target completion: +1 bonus X

- Height climbed and KING KONG letters are cumulative across balls
- Switch hits and bonus X reset each ball
- Second treasure hunt doubles entirety of end-of-ball bonus for rest of game

The bonus system rewards consistent switch hitting and progression through major game features. The treasure hunt doubling effect can make late-game bonuses extremely valuable, especially when combined with high bonus multipliers from drop target completions.`,
